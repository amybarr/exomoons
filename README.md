# exomoons
Data and code related to exomoon formation via giant impacts.

Aneos-Iron.pdf:  Lists the ANEOS coefficients for iron used in our pilot study.
Angle5-movie-raw-images.zip: The raw JPG images showing the evolution of a MT=7ME collision of rock/metal bodies resulting in a large exomoon.
Dunite-ANEOS.pdf: Lists the ANEOS coefficients for dunite (forsterite) used in our pilot study.
angular_momentum.c: One of several small data analysis routines, used to calculate the angular momentum of the initial conditions
discard_empty.c: Used to process raw CTH output, including removal of cells that have zero mass. 
exomoon_pilot.study_data.txt: Inputs and outputs of the pilot study simulations -- a draft "look-up" table of our results.
masses.c: Data analysis routine to calculate the masses of the impactor and target from the zeroth time step in CTH.
